It is how raw data takes form—whether as a 2D visualization chart, a 3D model, a physical object, or an immersive environment. A well-designed representation enables a person to perceive and think about the information a dataset embodies. We push existing boundaries for data representations to be beyond the status quo of flat 2D, leveraging emerging technologies such as machine learning/AI, digital fabrication, immersive AR/VR headsets, planetarium-scale displays, advanced sensing techniques, and cognitive science principles to invent new paradigms that connect data with human experience. Our research follows a simple but powerful cycle: process, build, evaluate–transforming data, designing new representations, and studying how they shape human understanding.",
