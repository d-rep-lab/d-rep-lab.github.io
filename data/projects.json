      "description": "We explore how immersive technologies such as AR/VR and mixed reality setups can transform the way scientists and students engage with data. We collaborate with domain scientists, like in material science and optics, to explore the opportunities these emergent technologies afford for data-driven discovery and analysis. We also explore how a mixed-reality setup of bridging both the physical and virtual worlds can improve STEM learning for complex topics such as AI and data science. Through these investigations, we develop tools and guidelines that maximize the potential of these technologies for educational and analytical contexts.",

      "description": "Our research in fabrication focuses on revolutionizing how we develop interactive data physicalizations (i.e., physical data representations). These tangible artifacts offer a new modality of interacting with data and an opportunity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. A central challenge in creating interactive physicalizations is the cross-disciplinary expertise needed in visualization, fabrication, and electronics. We combine computational design and machine learning to develop computational pipelines that automate low-level engineering traditionally needed to make interactive objects. The interdisciplinarity of these works lends itself to addressing needs in other fields, such as robotics and computational fabrication.",

      "description": "As we introduce novel data representations, we want to ensure that they are perceptually effective. Perceptual effectiveness designs draw upon psychological insights to ensure design choices (e.g., color) carefully match how humans perceive information efficiently and accurately. While traditional visualizations (such as line charts and scatterplots) have been extensively studied, we lack comparable empirical investigations for emerging forms like immersive visualizations and data physicalizations. We conduct empirical investigations to examine the cognitive and perceptual processes involved in interpreting these novel data representations. These findings not only deepen our understanding of how people make sense of data in new mediums but also guide the design and development of more effective future systems.",
